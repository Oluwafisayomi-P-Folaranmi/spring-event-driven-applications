# spring-event-driven-applications

Spring's event-driven architecture is a powerful way to build loosely coupled applications by using **Spring Events**. It allows different parts of an application to communicate asynchronously, making it ideal for decoupled services, microservices, and real-time applications.

### **Core Concepts of Spring Event-Driven Architecture**
1. **Spring Events (`ApplicationEvent`)**  
   - Events are simple Java objects that extend `ApplicationEvent` (before Spring 4.2) or can be any POJO (from Spring 4.2+).
   - These objects carry data and are published to notify listeners.

2. **Event Publisher (`ApplicationEventPublisher`)**  
   - Components that generate and publish events implement `ApplicationEventPublisher`.
   - Example:
     ```java
     @Component
     public class CustomEventPublisher {
         @Autowired
         private ApplicationEventPublisher publisher;

         public void publish(String message) {
             publisher.publishEvent(new CustomEvent(this, message));
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Event Listener (`@EventListener`)**  
   - Listens for specific event types and reacts accordingly.
   - Example:
     ```java
     @Component
     public class CustomEventListener {
         @EventListener
         public void handleCustomEvent(CustomEvent event) {
             System.out.println("Received event: " + event.getMessage());
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Asynchronous Event Handling (`@Async`)**  
   - By default, event listeners run synchronously in the same thread.
   - To handle events asynchronously, use `@Async` (requires `@EnableAsync`).
   - Example:
     ```java
     @Component
     public class AsyncEventListener {
         @Async
         @EventListener
         public void handleAsyncEvent(CustomEvent event) {
             System.out.println("Handling async event: " + event.getMessage());
         }
     }
     ```

### **Use Cases of Event-Driven Architecture in Spring**
- **Microservices Communication** (e.g., one service notifies another when an order is placed)
- **Asynchronous Processing** (e.g., sending emails, logging, analytics)
- **Decoupled Components** (e.g., modular monolith or breaking a large system into small, independent parts)
- **Workflow Automation** (e.g., triggering actions when a business rule is met)
