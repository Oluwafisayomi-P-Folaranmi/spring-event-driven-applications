# spring-event-driven-applications

Spring's event-driven architecture is a powerful way to build loosely coupled applications by using **Spring Events**. It allows different parts of an application to communicate asynchronously, making it ideal for decoupled services, microservices, and real-time applications.

---

### **Core Concepts of Spring Event-Driven Architecture**
1. **Spring Events (`ApplicationEvent`)**  
   - Events are simple Java objects that extend `ApplicationEvent` (before Spring 4.2) or can be any POJO (from Spring 4.2+).
   - These objects carry data and are published to notify listeners.

2. **Event Publisher (`ApplicationEventPublisher`)**  
   - Components that generate and publish events implement `ApplicationEventPublisher`.
   - Example:
     ```java
     @Component
     public class CustomEventPublisher {
         @Autowired
         private ApplicationEventPublisher publisher;

         public void publish(String message) {
             publisher.publishEvent(new CustomEvent(this, message));
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Event Listener (`@EventListener`)**  
   - Listens for specific event types and reacts accordingly.
   - Example:
     ```java
     @Component
     public class CustomEventListener {
         @EventListener
         public void handleCustomEvent(CustomEvent event) {
             System.out.println("Received event: " + event.getMessage());
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Asynchronous Event Handling (`@Async`)**  
   - By default, event listeners run synchronously in the same thread.
   - To handle events asynchronously, use `@Async` (requires `@EnableAsync`).
   - Example:
     ```java
     @Component
     public class AsyncEventListener {
         @Async
         @EventListener
         public void handleAsyncEvent(CustomEvent event) {
             System.out.println("Handling async event: " + event.getMessage());
         }
     }
     ```

### **Use Cases of Event-Driven Architecture in Spring**
- **Microservices Communication** (e.g., one service notifies another when an order is placed)
- **Asynchronous Processing** (e.g., sending emails, logging, analytics)
- **Decoupled Components** (e.g., modular monolith or breaking a large system into small, independent parts)
- **Workflow Automation** (e.g., triggering actions when a business rule is met)

Would you like to explore practical examples, best practices, or use cases related to your microservices setup?
















Springâ€™s event-driven architecture is widely used in real-world applications, particularly in **microservices, enterprise applications, and real-time systems**. Letâ€™s explore some common **use cases** and how Spring events make them efficient.

---

## **1. Microservices Communication (Decoupled Services)**
### **Use Case:**  
In a microservices system, when **Service A** performs an action (e.g., creating an order), **Service B** (e.g., inventory service) needs to react without being tightly coupled to Service A.

### **Implementation with Spring Events:**
- **OrderService** publishes an event when an order is placed.
- **InventoryService** listens to this event and updates the stock.

#### **Event Class:**
```java
public class OrderPlacedEvent {
    private final String orderId;

    public OrderPlacedEvent(String orderId) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
    }

    public String getOrderId() {
        return orderId;
    }
}
```

#### **Event Publisher (Order Service):**
```java
@Component
public class OrderService {
    @Autowired
    private ApplicationEventPublisher publisher;

    public void placeOrder(String orderId) {
        System.out.println("Placing order: " + orderId);
        publisher.publishEvent(new OrderPlacedEvent(orderId));
    }
}
```

#### **Event Listener (Inventory Service):**
```java
@Component
public class InventoryService {
    @EventListener
    public void handleOrderPlaced(OrderPlacedEvent event) {
        System.out.println("Updating inventory for order: " + event.getOrderId());
    }
}
```

ðŸ’¡ **Advantage:**  
- Services are **loosely coupled**â€”the `InventoryService` doesnâ€™t directly depend on `OrderService`.
- Can be easily extended by adding new listeners (e.g., `ShippingService`).

---

## **2. Asynchronous Processing (Background Tasks)**
### **Use Case:**  
When a user registers, send a **welcome email** asynchronously without blocking the main thread.

### **Implementation with `@Async`:**
#### **Event Class:**
```java
public class UserRegisteredEvent {
    private final String email;

    public UserRegisteredEvent(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }
}
```

#### **Event Publisher (User Service):**
```java
@Component
public class UserService {
    @Autowired
    private ApplicationEventPublisher publisher;

    public void registerUser(String email) {
        System.out.println("Registering user: " + email);
        publisher.publishEvent(new UserRegisteredEvent(email));
    }
}
```

#### **Asynchronous Event Listener (Email Service):**
```java
@Component
@EnableAsync
public class EmailService {
    @Async
    @EventListener
    public void sendWelcomeEmail(UserRegisteredEvent event) {
        System.out.println("Sending welcome email to: " + event.getEmail());
    }
}
```

ðŸ’¡ **Advantage:**  
- The registration process **does not wait** for the email to be sent.
- Improves performance by offloading non-critical tasks.

---

## **3. Workflow Automation (Chained Events)**
### **Use Case:**  
An e-commerce system automatically:
1. Places an order.
2. Reduces inventory.
3. Notifies shipping service.
4. Sends a confirmation email.

Each step **triggers the next event**, making the system more dynamic.

### **Event Chain Flow:**
- **OrderPlacedEvent** â†’ Triggers **InventoryUpdatedEvent**.
- **InventoryUpdatedEvent** â†’ Triggers **ShippingScheduledEvent**.
- **ShippingScheduledEvent** â†’ Triggers **OrderConfirmationEvent**.

ðŸ’¡ **Advantage:**  
- New workflow steps can be **added without modifying existing services**.
- Each service reacts to its specific event, ensuring modularity.

---

## **4. Real-Time Event Streaming (Kafka, RabbitMQ, WebSockets)**
### **Use Case:**  
In a stock trading app, real-time updates are sent when a stock price changes.

### **Implementation Using Spring Events + WebSockets:**
- `StockPriceUpdateEvent` is published whenever a stock price changes.
- WebSocket listeners push updates to clients.

#### **Stock Price Update Event:**
```java
public class StockPriceUpdateEvent {
    private final String stockSymbol;
    private final double newPrice;

    public StockPriceUpdateEvent(String stockSymbol, double newPrice) {
        this.stockSymbol = stockSymbol;
        this.newPrice = newPrice;
    }

    public String getStockSymbol() {
        return stockSymbol;
    }

    public double getNewPrice() {
        return newPrice;
    }
}
```

#### **Publishing Stock Price Update:**
```java
@Component
public class StockService {
    @Autowired
    private ApplicationEventPublisher publisher;

    public void updateStockPrice(String symbol, double price) {
        System.out.println("Stock price updated: " + symbol + " - " + price);
        publisher.publishEvent(new StockPriceUpdateEvent(symbol, price));
    }
}
```

#### **WebSocket Event Listener:**
```java
@Component
public class StockWebSocketListener {
    @Autowired
    private SimpMessagingTemplate messagingTemplate;

    @EventListener
    public void pushStockUpdate(StockPriceUpdateEvent event) {
        messagingTemplate.convertAndSend("/topic/stocks", event);
    }
}
```

ðŸ’¡ **Advantage:**  
- Users receive **real-time stock updates**.
- Decouples **stock updates** from **frontend notification logic**.

---

## **5. Audit Logging & Monitoring**
### **Use Case:**  
Log every **user action** (e.g., login, logout, password change) in an **audit service** without modifying the main application logic.

### **Implementation:**
- When a user logs in, a `UserLoggedInEvent` is published.
- The audit service listens to this event and stores the log.

#### **Audit Event Listener:**
```java
@Component
public class AuditService {
    @EventListener
    public void logUserAction(UserLoggedInEvent event) {
        System.out.println("Audit Log: User " + event.getUsername() + " logged in.");
    }
}
```

ðŸ’¡ **Advantage:**  
- Adds monitoring **without modifying business logic**.
- Can extend to **external logging services** (e.g., ELK, Prometheus).

---

## **6. CQRS & Event Sourcing**
### **Use Case:**  
Separate **command (write)** and **query (read)** models to improve scalability.

- **Write Service** publishes events.
- **Read Service** listens and updates materialized views.

ðŸ’¡ **Advantage:**  
- Enables **scalable and high-performance** read operations.
- Supports **event replay** for debugging and consistency.

---
